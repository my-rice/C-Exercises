# C exercises
This repository contains exercises in C to practise algorithms and data structures, such as linked lists, trees, hash maps, arrays and so on. The exercises are divided into different folders, each one containing a different exercise, each one asks to implement different functions that solve a specific problem. More description about each exercise can be found in the README.md file in each folder. 

The exercises are solved in C because it is a low-level language that allows to understand how data structures and algorithms work in a more detailed way.
